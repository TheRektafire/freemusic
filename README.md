# Central repo for all my copyright free songs
Often when i'm looking for royalty free/copyright free songs to use online I tend to come across these content creators that supposedly make so called "copyright free music" that either:

**A)** doesn't specify any actual license, at most you'll usually get a "lol you can totally use it in your videos for free bro", which doesn't fill me with much legal confidence,

or **B)** it just straight up isn't actually copyright free and you're highly likely to get a content ID claim or some equivalent

The person who wrote the [suckless](https://suckless.org/sucks/) site should add a "music' section and add specifically that to it due to how much it sucks...

In my case I want to make 100% sure that people who want to use my music in their stuff can be reliably ensured that the music can ACTUALLY be used, so, I created this repo to catalogue all the free music I release from now on with their respective licenses so the usage terms are immediately visible and obvious.
